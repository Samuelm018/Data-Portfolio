Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
About the Project
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for any business. In this project, I analyzed bank customer data and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to understand who is leaving, when they leave, and what factors influence churn.

The goal was not just to visualize numbers, but to create a dashboard that helps decision-makers quickly spot high-risk customers and take action to improve retention.

What I Tried to Solve
Why are customers churning?

Which customer segments are at higher risk?

How do factors like age, credit score, balance, activity status, and product usage impact churn?

How can this information be presented clearly to non-technical stakeholders?

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 10,000 bank customers with details such as:

Age, gender, and country

Credit score and account balance

Number of products used

Credit card ownership

Active/inactive status

Churn indicator

Key Insights
Some of the insights visible in the dashboard:

Inactive customers show a much higher churn rate

Certain age groups are more likely to churn than others

Customers with lower credit scores tend to leave more often

Product usage plays a strong role in customer retention

Churn behavior differs across countries

Tools Used
Power BI for data modeling and visualization

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

DAX for calculated measures and KPIs

Dashboard Highlights
